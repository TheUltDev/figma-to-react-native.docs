This guide will walk you through the process of using the Figma to React Native plugin to generate code from your Figma designs.

## Exporting a Single Component

You can quickly generate the code for a single component directly from the Figma canvas.

1.  **Select a Component**: In Figma, select the component you want to export.
2.  **Open the Plugin**: Run the Figma to React Native plugin.
3.  **View Generated Code**: The plugin will display the generated React Native code, a Storybook story, and theme information in the codegen panel.

The generated code will look something like this:

```tsx
// Example generated component
import * as React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

export function MyComponent(props) {
  return (
    <View style={styles.root}>
      <Text style={styles.label}>{props.labelText}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  root: {
    /* ... */
  },
  label: {
    /* ... */
  },
});
```

## Building a Project

For larger projects, you can export multiple components at once and generate a complete project structure.

1.  **Open the Plugin**: Run the Figma to React Native plugin.
2.  **Configure Export**: In the plugin's UI, you can configure the export settings:
    *   **Scope**: Choose to export the entire document, a specific page, or only the selected components.
    *   **Method**: Select whether to download the files or sync with a local development server.
3.  **Initiate Build**: Click the "Build" button to start the process.
4.  **Receive a Zip File**: The plugin will generate a `.zip` file containing all the exported components, assets, a theme file, and an `index.ts` file that exports everything.

### Structure of the Exported Project

The exported project will have a structure similar to this:

```
project/
├── assets/
│   ├── img/
│   └── svg/
├── components/
│   ├── page-name/
│   │   ├── section-name/
│   │   │   ├── component-name/
│   │   │   │   ├── ComponentName.tsx
│   │   │   │   ├── ComponentName.story.tsx
│   │   │   │   └── index.ts
├── theme.ts
└── index.ts
```

-   `assets/`: Contains all the exported images and SVGs.
-   `components/`: Contains the generated React Native components, organized by page and section.
-   `theme.ts`: The generated theme file based on your Figma variables.
-   `index.ts`: The main entry point that exports all components.
