**Figma to React Native** is a powerful plugin for Figma that bridges the gap between design and development. It analyzes your Figma components and generates clean, maintainable, and production-ready React Native code, allowing you to build beautiful and functional mobile applications faster than ever.

## Key Features

<Cards>
  <Card title="Component Generation" href="/docs/features#component-generation">
    Automatically convert Figma components, including variants and properties, into reusable React Native components.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dynamic Styling" href="/docs/features#styling">
    Leverage the power of `react-native-unistyles` to generate a complete design system from your Figma variables, including themes, colors, and typography.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Storybook Integration" href="/docs/features#storybook-integration">
    Generate Storybook stories for your components out of the box, making it easy to test and document your UI.
  </Card>
    <Card title="Asset Handling" href="/docs/features#assets">
    Effortlessly export and manage assets, including vectors (SVGs) and raster images.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## How It Works

The plugin inspects the structure, styles, and properties of your Figma components. It then uses a sophisticated code generation engine to translate your designs into React Native code.

- **Parser**: The parser traverses your Figma components, extracting information about layers, styles, assets, and component properties.
- **Generator**: The generator takes the parsed information and builds the corresponding React Native files, including components, stylesheets, and Storybook stories.
- **Theming**: The plugin can extract your Figma color and text styles, as well as variables, to create a comprehensive theme file.
