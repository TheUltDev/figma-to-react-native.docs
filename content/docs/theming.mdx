The Figma to React Native plugin provides a robust theming system that helps you maintain a consistent and scalable design system. The core of this system is the `theme.ts` file, which is generated from your Figma variables and local styles.

## Theme Generation

The `generateTheme` function is responsible for creating your theme. It processes your Figma variables to generate a theme object that includes colors, typography, breakpoints, and more.

### Variables

The plugin looks for specific variable collections in your Figma file:

-   `Themes`: For defining theme-specific colors (e.g., light and dark modes).
-   `Colors (Scale)`: For your global color palette.
-   `Fonts`: For defining font families and weights.
-   `Fonts (Scale)`: For your typography scale (font sizes, line heights).
-   `Breakpoints`: For responsive design breakpoints.
-   `Display (Scale)`: For spacing and sizing scales.

### Generated Theme File

The generated `theme.ts` file will look similar to this:

```ts
export const themes = {
  light: {
    colors: {
      background: '#ffffff',
      foreground: '#0f172a',
      // ... more colors
    },
    breakpoints: {
      // ... breakpoints
    },
    // ... other theme properties
  },
  dark: {
    // ... dark theme properties
  },
} as const;
```

## Importing a Theme

The plugin allows you to import predefined color schemes to quickly set up your design system.

### Color Presets

You can choose from a variety of color presets, such as "Slate", "Grey", "Red", etc. When you import a preset, the plugin will create a set of color variables in your Figma file corresponding to that color scheme.

### Custom Themes

You can also create a theme from a custom brand color. The plugin will take your base color and generate a full color scale from it, allowing you to create a unique and branded theme for your application.

## Using the Theme

The generated theme is designed to be used with `react-native-unistyles`. You can access theme values in your components like this:

```tsx
import { createStyleSheet, useStyles } from 'react-native-unistyles';

function MyComponent() {
  const { styles, theme } = useStyles(stylesheet);

  return <View style={styles.root} />;
}

const stylesheet = createStyleSheet(theme => ({
  root: {
    backgroundColor: theme.colors.background,
    padding: theme.display.md,
  },
}));
```
