This section covers some of the more advanced features of the Figma to React Native plugin, including icon management, pre-built components, and internationalization.

## Icon Management

The plugin has a powerful icon management system that allows you to import icons from [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) and use them in your designs and generated code.

### Importing Icon Sets

You can import entire icon sets from Iconify. The plugin will create a new page in your Figma file named "Icons" and populate it with the icons from the selected set.

1.  **Open the Plugin**: Run the Figma to React Native plugin.
2.  **Go to the Icons Tab**: Navigate to the icon management section of the plugin.
3.  **Select a Set**: Choose an icon set to import.
4.  **Import**: The plugin will create the icon components in your Figma file.

The imported icons are created as individual components and can be used in your designs just like any other component. When you export a component that uses an icon, the plugin will automatically handle the necessary imports.

## Pre-built Components (EXO)

The plugin includes a set of pre-built components, referred to as "EXO components". These are common UI elements that you can import into your project to speed up your design and development process.

### Importing EXO Components

You can import these components from the plugin's UI. They will be added to a "Base" page in your Figma file. These components are fully compatible with the plugin's code generation and theming systems.

Some of the available EXO components include:

-   Buttons
-   Sliders
-   Popovers
-   Placeholders

## Internationalization (i18n)

The plugin has support for internationalization through `lingui`.

When the "translate" option is enabled in the plugin settings, the generator will wrap text content in a `t` template literal or a `<Trans>` component. This makes your application's text content ready for translation.

```tsx
// Example with translation
import { t } from '@lingui/macro';

function MyComponent() {
  return <Text>{t`Hello, World!`}</Text>;
}
```
This is based on `writeChildren.ts` which has a `settings?.addTranslate` flag and uses `lingui`.
The `generateBundle` function in `project.ts` also shows logic for extracting locales and translations from Figma variables.

## Motion & Animations

The plugin has built-in support for creating animations and interactions using `framer-motion` syntax. You can define motion props for different interaction states like `initial`, `hover`, `press`, `enter`, and `exit`.

These are configured through the plugin's node attributes UI and are translated into props for a `Motion.View` or `Motion.Text` component from `react-exo/motion`. You can define transitions with types like `tween` or `spring` and configure properties like duration, delay, and easing.
